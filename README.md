# Pan-Tompkins (Python)

This is a simple implementation of Pan-Tompkins algorithm using Python. It's an University project we developed
during the IT course.

The program includes four main features:

1) Data extraction from `.txt` document (we used data from Physionet)

2) Data analysis using Pan-Tompkins algorithm (we only implemented the first part, not the decision rule):

- band-pass filter in two version:
  - FIR filter
  - IIR filter
- derivative filter
- squaring transformation
- moving average filter

3) Heart Rate Variability (HRV) calculation and medium heart rate calculation 

4) Graphics to show results and result saving

In order to run the program, you have to run the first four blocks, then in the fifth and in the sixth you have to enter
text file path and sampling frequency. Then you can run the remaining part of the program and see the results.

### Required libraries

- scipy

- numpy

- matplotlib

The project report includes more detailed information about our project, our code and our results.

All the material is now available only in Italian, further development will include English translation (maybe xD).
